## Overview
This project is a simple desktop application that helps users manage CSV files. It allows you to edit, update, add, and remove data from CSV files in an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Itâ€™s perfect for beginners to understand both Python programming and the usage of Tkinter for creating GUIs.

## Features
- **Load CSV Files:** Open and display the contents of a CSV file.
- **Edit Rows:** Modify existing data in the table.
- **Add Rows:** Insert new rows of data.
- **Delete Rows:** Remove unwanted rows from the file.
- **Save Changes:** Save the changes back to the CSV file.

## Code Explanation

### Modules Used
- **`tkinter`**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **`csv`**: Used to read and write CSV files.
- **`os`**: Helps in handling file operations.

### GUI with Tkinter
Tkinter provides the tools for building the interface. The project includes components like:

- **Buttons**: Trigger actions such as opening a file, saving changes, or adding/removing rows.
- **Labels and Entry Widgets**: Display and take input from the user.
- **Treeview (from ttk)**: Displays the contents of the CSV file in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet.

Example snippet for the GUI:
```python
root = Tk()
root.title("CSV Manager")

# Create a Treeview to display the CSV data
tree = ttk.Treeview(root, columns=("Name", "Age", "Country"), show='headings')
```

### CSV Operations
- **Load CSV**: Opens a file dialog to select a CSV file and loads its content into the Treeview.
  ```python
  with open(filename, 'r') as file:
      reader = csv.reader(file)
      for row in reader:
          tree.insert('', 'end', values=row)
  ```

- **Add Row**: Appends a new row to the Treeview and prepares to save it to the file.
  ```python
  tree.insert('', 'end', values=("", "", ""))
  ```

- **Edit Row**: Selects a specific row for editing. The user can input new data.
- **Delete Row**: Deletes the selected row from the Treeview and marks it for removal from the file.
  ```python
  selected_item = tree.selection()[0]  # Get selected item
  tree.delete(selected_item)
  ```

- **Save Changes**: Writes the updated data back to the CSV file.
  ```python
  with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as file:
      writer = csv.writer(file)
      for row_id in tree.get_children():
          row = tree.item(row_id)['values']
          writer.writerow(row)
  ```

## How to Use
1. Open the application.
2. Click "Load CSV" to select and load a CSV file.
3. Use the "Add Row," "Edit Row," or "Delete Row" buttons to manage data.
4. Save your changes by clicking "Save."
